# TPro team Koding Global Virtual Hackaton's Submission
[![Koding Hackathon](/badge.png?raw=true "Koding Hackathon")](http://koding.com/Hackathon)
## Description

Our team decided to mix **Problems facing our planet, explained using interactive data visualization** and **HTML5 games that are educational and learning oriented** themes. The ratio is approximately 70/30 :)

We are software developers that work in financial industry, so we decided to write something really different from an enterprise software, fun and not money-oriented. Online game forcing players to solve global problems together ideally fitted into this parameters.

As a result, we are submitting *alpha version* of **a multiplayer online browser game called "Biosphere project"**.

In this game, each player rules one earth region (North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia and Oceania).

Player can:
* Change taxes
* Decide to research industry, medicine
* Choose a balance between productivity and ecology (investing into corresponding areas).

Each decision made by player affects not only local parameters (funds, industry level, population, happiness, etc.), but also global ones - water and air pollution, oil resources, forest areas, etc. Each single player can't build ideal world ignoring others - as the biosphere is common for all of us: for example, if someone pollutes atmosphere and ignores medicine - all other players will suffer from polluted air and an immigration from the problem region.

We have build live chat into the game, where players can discuss the situation, ask other players to change priorities, and so on. Players can send budget money to each other asking to spend them on discussed goals, but, they can't force them to do it (as in real life). Return of the money is also subject of a discuss into the chat.

### Goal

Our goal was to create a game to teach players that global problems should be solved cooperatively, and that the balance between ecology and well-being is a process, not an end point.

### TODO

No AI done at the moment to play for some countries instead of humans. Diplomacy is limited with chatbox, you can't run sanctions against other countries or cooperate to research science/medicine faster or cheaper. All countries use the same currency, so it's impossible now to simulate things like inflation, etc. As we had 48 hours only, game process isn't fine-tuned, and some artifacts in gameplay are possible.

Our team is looking forward to continue this project, to present it to broader audience.
